    <h1> What We Do </h1>
    <p> Long story short, we kill people. We're assailants directly in the pocket of the infamous Dragon Prince, what did you expect!? Okay but really, most of us want to see 
      the Empire of Doryoku fall and or burn to the ground. Our hatred runs deep and we ain't stopping for no one! Some of us are motivated by loyalty (that'd be our captain), 
      some of us are motivated by revenge (me, Uchu, the pegasus knight Fuyuuki, and the berserker Takeru) are in it for revenge, and the last two (sniper Cateye and dancer
      Aaliyah) have personal goals they want to see through. Don't ask me what they are, I don't know them and they wouldn't let me put in on this website. Phooey. </p>
