  <h1> How to Contact Us </h1>
  <p> This is something of a weird topic because, like I mentioned earlier, we work directly under the Dragon Prince. If you want one or all of us to hunt someone down for you,
    the request has to go through His Highness first. In fact, I don't know why he wanted me to make this page considering that our time is better spent furthering the Dragon 
    side of the war effort, but oh well! If you want to request the aid of the Blood Council, just get a message to the Dragon Prince. Don't let it get found out, and most 
    importantly, make sure it doesn't pass through Doryokan hands. On that note, WE DO NOT ACCEPT ANY REQUESTS FROM CITIZENS OR RESIDENTS OF DORYOKU AND ITS ALLIES. It 
    doesn't matter if you're a poor, starving peasant family, if you're Doryokan, Balinoirian, or Andharan, your request will be ignored and denied. </p>
