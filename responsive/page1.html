    <h1> Welcome. We are the Blood Council. </h1>
    <p> We're the baddest, deadliest, and most vicious warriors around, directly serving under His Grandious Highness Himself, the great Dragon Prince. We've got an assassin 
      (that would be me), a witch, a berserker, a pegasus knight, a combat puppet, a sniper, and a dancer. Guess which one our captain is (hint: it's not me). Since His Highness
      decreed that we should try getting our name out more, we created this website (or rather, I did since apparently I'm the only one with the right skillset; Uchu helped 
      too, she's the witch). Anyway, yeah, that's who we are. If you're not a Dragon or a Poseidon or a Rimese get ready to be massacred and left for dead in the dirt. </p>
