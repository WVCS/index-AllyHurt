    <h1> THIS IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS A DISCLAIMER. </h1>
    <p> Alright, so I am what's known as an "author." I write stuff; I write books specifically. This hypothetical "event" takes place in the world of my Runaway Magician 
      series, specifically in the time frame of the second book, The Flower of Death and the Glass Keys. HOWEVER, this "Autumn School Festival" DOES NOT OCCUR within the actual
      book itself or in the series at all. It is a fiction of a fiction, if that makes sense. Sorry if you saw this website and were looking forward to kids doing fun school
      stuff in the book. That is NOT what happens at all, oh no. I am far too mcuh of a sadist and unforgiving author to do that I'm afraid. </p>
