    <h1> Our Origins </h1>
    <p> My wife and I were simple peasants with nine beautiful daughters; one day, a great snake monster appeared calling itself the Orochi and managed to devour nine of our eight 
      daughters. All hope we thought we had lost until who should appear but Susano'o-no-Mikoto, the great storm god! He graciously answered our pleas and in exchange for our last
      remaining daughter's hand in marriage, he slaid the Orochi for us! Now we serve delicious sushi in the name of Susano'o-no-Mikoto. </p>
