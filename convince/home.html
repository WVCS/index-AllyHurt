  <h2> This is a Shellos. </h2>
  <h2> As you can see, it is round and squishy. </h2> 
    <p> Shellos can also kill Kyogres, aka big screw-you shamu. (I would use a different word but we're trying to keep things PG-13 here.) </p>

    <p> Shellos can also become Water/Ground-type, aka go suck it, Pikachu. (No, NOT ENERGY BALL!!!) </p>

    <h3> Who wouldn't find this cute? Who wouldn't? Would YOU!? </h3>
    <p> Then perish. </p>
    <p> Thank you for coming to my TedTalk. </p>
